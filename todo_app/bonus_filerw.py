"""The zip() Function
In the coding area, we have defined two lists. Each country in the first list 
should be written in a new file corresponding to the name in the filenames list. So, 
"Albania" should be written in a new a.txt file, "Belgium" in a new "b.txt" file and so on."""

#     with open(filename,"w") as file:
#         file.write(country)

"""Creating Multiple Text Files
In the coding area, we have defined a list of countries. Add some code that uses a for loop to
generate a text file for each country (e.g., "Albania.txt", "Belgium.txt", and so on).

Each file should have its country name as content (e.g., Albania.txt has Albania as content).
